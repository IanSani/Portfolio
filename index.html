    <div class="margin">
    <p>So far i have managed to create some of the following projects which you can find on git hub.
     Check out <a href="https://github.com/IanSani/favourite-things/">Favourite-Things.</a>It was developed by html and css,just as the name
     suggest it was a project made in mind to show my favourite things.It is also  one of the projects i started with.</p>

    <p> Another project is <a href="https://github.com/IanSani/travel-agency/">Travel-Agency</a> which was a practice project which personally
       i think i tried. It was made using html together with css. It was webpage about a travel agency displaying their services and information
      including  their<strong> most popular</strong> and <strong>tropical destinations.</strong></p>

    <p> In total i worked on three projects which the last one you can check it here <a href="https://github.com/IanSani/my-first-webpage/">First-Webpage.</a>
      It also contains html and css. IT was just a practice project so there is not much to say about it.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="sidebar"
    <p>Let me start first of all with my educational background. Primary school i attended a school by the name of M.M Shah for 8 years where i did my Kenya Certificate of
      primary education. I later joined high school from 2013-2016 at Kisumu Day High school.In terms of job experience i do not have any though i expect some in the near future. </p>

    <p>I have always had an interest in programming .The only thing holding me back was that i did not know how to code amd let alone know any programming language.
      Some of  the reasons that made me take a class on programming was that i wanted to be a developer,buiding web apps and android apps that would solve problems and
      change lives.I also want to be an enterprenuer and in future maybe start a <em>start up</em> of my own. But majorly it was the interest that led me to take a class. </p>
