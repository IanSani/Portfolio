    <p>So far i have managed to create some of the following projects which you can find on git hub.
     Check out <a href="https://github.com/IanSani/favourite-things/">Favourite-Things.</a>It was developed by html and css,just as the name
     suggest it was a project made in mind to show my favourite things.It is also  one of the projects i started with.</p>
    <p> Another project is <a href="https://github.com/IanSani/travel-agency/">Travel-Agency</a> which was a practice project which personally
       i think i tried. It was made using html together with css. It was webpage about a travel agency displaying their services and information
      including  their<strong> most popular</strong> and <strong>tropical destinations.</strong></p>
    <p> In total i worked on three projects which the last one you can check it here <a href="https://github.com/IanSani/my-first-webpage/">First-Webpage.</a>
      It also contains html and css. IT was just a practice project so there is not much to say about it.
